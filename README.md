## Project sections
- **HEADER:** Here you will find the name and logo of this application, and a navigation menu that will allow you to move between the sections of this page. The main page, called "BALANCE"; in "CATEGORIES" there are some pre-loaded categories and the possibility of creating your own; and in "REPORTS" will be the summaries and balances of your operations.
- **OPERATIONS:** In this section you can find all the operations that you have entered (expenses or profits). And if you have not added any operations yet, you will find a button that will direct you to a form where you can add the details of your expenses or earnings, with a description, an amount, a category to choose from and a date. Information that will later be used to make your reports.
- **BALANCE:** Here you can see printed the positive and negative amounts of your operations, and the calculation of the balance between them.
- **FILTERS:** This section will help you filter your operations, whether it is an expense or a profit, by category, by date, or there are also options to order them by amount or alphabetically.
- **CATEGORIES:** In this section you will find the table that will show you the categories that exist and a form to be able to create and add to the list, all the categories that you want.
- **REPORTS:** Here will be the summary of all your operations. You will see the categories and dates with the highest profit, with the highest expense or the highest balance. You also find two tables with the totals for each category and for the dates of the operations.

**IMPORTANT**
You will have to know that the information about your operations will only be saved if you use the application in the same browser. If you want to use it from another site or device, the application will start from the beginning again.
